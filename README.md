# draft-js-rte
This is a version of the rich text editor I created, built on the [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org) framework for React. A live demo is here: [https://draft-js-rte-evanmorrison.netlify.com](https://draft-js-rte-evanmorrison.netlify.com). You can see other examples of my work at [evmorrison.com](https://evmorrison.com).

Notable features include:
- support for tables
- insert and resize images
- insert and edit links
